    <p>Alhamdo-llilah! By the grace of Allah, this organization is serving <br>
         the poor and the distressed people of our society since 5th May 1999.<br> 
         We are a part of a society where the majority of the people residing <br>
         in villages and towns are living below the poverty line and even <br> 
         deprived of the basic necessities of life. Now let us take a look at <br> 
         the life of the people living in cities, where unfortunately living <br>
         conditions are not much different. If we examine their family size, <br> 
         we find a very painful situation, where in a small rented house the <br>
         husband and the wife with their four children survive with a very low <br>
         earning. In today’s world where inflation is at its peak, it is impossible <br>
         for them to pay for their electricity, children’s education and any medical <br>
        treatment of any family member. How will the head of the family be able to <br> 
         provide for the needs of his children?? The result: he takes loans. He is <br>
        not to be blamed because he is responsible to provide three meals a day for his <br>
        family and he is forced to use the wrong means to fulfill his family’s needs.<br>
        Undoubtedly, the poor and the needy are helpless. Our organization spends time with<br> 
        them and is fully aware of their problems and weaknesses. Therefore we want to help <br>
        them in such a way that all financial aid is free from interest. In view of all the <br>
        difficulties faced by the poor, Saylani Welfare International Trust has organized 63<br>
        different sectors to sort out the problems of the ones who are in need. These departments<br>
         are efficiently working for the cause of the society. By the Grace of the Almighty Allah,<br> 
         it can be proudly said that this organization has become a back-bone of the poor society <br>
         and provides help after a complete inquiry survey. This organization receives aid from <br>
         different parts of the world. Each and every penny is spent after a strict inquiry and a <br>
         utilization report is delivered to those who send this aid to us. In this report, addresses<br> 
         of the people to whom these donations have been given, is mentioned with details. This shows<br>
          that your money has been given to the right people. You can also contact these people with <br>
          the help of their addresses and get a confirmation whether the organization has provided <br>
          them with the aid and if they are really the ones who deserve. In a way, your sadaqa or <br>
          zakaat is being spent with your own hands. Our aim is to inquire and survey to find the <br>
          ones who need us.</p>
